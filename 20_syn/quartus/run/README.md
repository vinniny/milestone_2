# Quartus Project Scaffolding (Milestone 2)

Target board: Altera/Intel DE2 (Cyclone II)

Instructions
- Create a new Quartus project in this folder (`20_syn/quartus/run`).
- Set top-level entity/module to `singlecycle` (source in `00_src/singlecycle.sv`).
- Add all sources from `00_src/`.
- Enable SystemVerilog for `.sv` files.
- Add timing constraints (`.sdc`) and pin assignments later.

Notes
- Do not synthesize now; this is scaffolding to mirror the milestone tree.
- Place board-specific `.qsf`/`.sdc` and pin constraint files here when ready.
